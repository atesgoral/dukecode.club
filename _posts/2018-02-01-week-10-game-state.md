title: "Game State"
week: 10

This week we'll add different states to the game to make it feel more like a game that has a start and an end.

{: .panel .snapshot }

We'll figure out what different states the game will have and then start writing some code for it during today's session! I'll fill in this page with the decisions and code we've come up with!
